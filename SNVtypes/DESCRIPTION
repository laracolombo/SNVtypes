Description: The main functionality of this package is providing the mutation type of all the single nucleotide variants that are present in a VCF file. The package takes as input a complete VCF file, filters only single nucleotide variants and determines the mutation type in the "A[C>T]G" notation. It avoids redundancy by showing only C or T as mutated reference base (therefore the reverse sequence might be returned). Plots and count tables to summarize the results are available.
