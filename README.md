# SNVtypes
SNVtypes is an R package that I developed as a project for a Scientific Programming course delivederd by the Politecnico of Milan for the M.Sc. in Bioinformatics for computational genomics. 
It provides function to determine the mutation types of single nucleotide variants stored in VCF mutation files.
