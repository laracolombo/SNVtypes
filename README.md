# SNVtypes
SNVtypes is a Bioconductor package that I developed as a project for a Scientific Programming course delivederd by the Politecnico of Milan (M.Sc. in Bioinformatics for computational genomics).

It provides functions to determine the mutation types of single nucleotide variants stored in VCF files.
